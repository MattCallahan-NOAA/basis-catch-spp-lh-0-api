## Subject
The basis_catch web service provides BASIS survey catch level information by species, and life history stage from the AKFIN database 

## Background 
This query was designed so EMA scientists could easily share BASIS data without needing logins, VPN connections, etc. 

Something about BASIS...

## Data Sources
This web service queries the basisfish_event, basisfish_catch, basisfish_lifehistorystage, basisfish_trawlgear, and basisfish_trawl_performance tables in the EMA schema. Data includes catches of zero. See below for query logic. 
Look up optional TSN filter through 'https://apex.psmfc.org/akfin/data_marts/akmp/basis_tsn'

<br>

## Data Access URL
**Base URL:** https://apex.psmfc.org/akfin/data_marts/akmp/basis_catch_spp_lh_0

<br>


**Parameters**


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
